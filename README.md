# GreenLight

The dream was to make this a task / todo manager for tasks that need to be repeated regularly, like stretching and staying hydrated during the workday, remembering to do laundry every two days, and taking the recycling out on wednesdays - but unfortunately a combination of illness and family crisis meant I only had a small time to work on it and so the feature set is very limited. Sorry! You'll find there are some obvious issues in the codebase to fix, but if you want a legacy project that's mainly about adding features, this is one for you!

# Startup
You'll need a mongoDB instance running on the default port, and you can then use
```nodemon index.js``` from /server for the server, and
```npm run dev``` from /client to start the frontend.

The app runs well enough for you to input some tasks yourself using the included form.
